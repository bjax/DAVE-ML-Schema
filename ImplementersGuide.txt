Ordered

DAVE-ML groups variables and the associated calculations to determine
them (if any) separately from breakpoint sets, gridded and ungridded
tables, and function definitions, which are likewise grouped
together. There is no guarantee or requirement that the variables are
defined in execution order; in fact, it is very unlikely that the
elements of DAVE-ML will appear in execution order. Thus, the
implementor must sort these elements for proper operation; the means
to do this sort are not specified but should be determinable from the
embedded calculations (which indicate dependence of one variable on
another) and the independentVarRefs and dependentVarRef of the
function elements.

Warnings on unresolved elements

Inputs and outputs are usually identified, but older releases prior to 2.0RC2 did
not explicitly identify inputs.
