How to release new DAVEfunc.dtd file:

do {

  Edit Auto_DTD/DAVEfunc_dtd.xml to make changes to DTD; edit
  DAVE-ML_ref.xml to make corresponding changes to the reference book.

  Be sure to remove existing "revisionflag='changed' or ='added'"
  before editing; add new revisionflags as appropriate to delimit the
  changes.

  Be sure to check the version number in the DAVEfunc_dtd.xml source
  file in TWO places: the Version line and the SYSTEM id.

  Update the <releaseinfo> of the ref manual with release date (now
  that we've left SVN behind).

  In the trunk directory, 'make all' to generate a local copy of
  updated PDF, HTML, Text and WordML - check for errors

  Poke through the updated reference manual to see if it's OK.

  Test the new DAVEfunc.dtd in the validation_lab directory:

    1. validate it with Oxygen
    2. validate against known .dml's in Oxygen

  This is accomplished by 

    1. running 'make' in the validation lab directory to copy latest
        versions of known .dml's there

    2. opening validation_lab/validation.xpr and
        clicking 'validate all documents.'

    3. run 'make' in the DAVEtools/tests/app_tests/dave2sl folder;
       see if all is well with resulting models

[ Running jing (~/downloaded_sw/jing) in validation lab against each
  example with the new DTD is a good idea (probably should automate
  sometime - however, I'm getting an error, "conflicting ID-types for
  attribute "id" of element "notin" from namespace
  "http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML")

  The .rnc verision of the DAVEfunc schema is made by the
  Auto_DTD/Makefile.

    java -jar ~/downloaded_sw/jing/bin/jing.jar -c DAVEfunc.rnc \
    example.xml
]

} until completely happy

git commit all changes

remove 'DTDs/new' directory in web site (if it exists)

run 'make install' to copy revision to DTD directory in WebSites folder

[should also automate]: 

cp Auto_DTD/DAVEfunc_auto.dtd to
Schemas/trunk/DAVEfunc.dtd and to ~/Documents/Dev/DAVE/Documents

cd to Schemas

git tag V_2p2rc1-2010-03-28

In ~/Documents/Dev/DAVE/Documents directory:
   * make sure have latest version of DAVEfunc.dtd
   * svn commit DAVEfunc.dtd 

In the ~/Documents/Web_sites/DAVE_web_site/DTDs directory, 
   - rename 'new' to '2p0' or whatever
   - modify 'dev' to point to new entry
   - add the new 2p0 directory to repository

Fire up Dreamweaver / Emacs

  edit the index.html and DTDs.html as necessary to make changes.and
  do a Site:Synchronize to update all files (except CVS,
  note_for_ebj.txt, and any #emacstemp# files).

Log onto webser01 (dcb.larc.nasa.gov) bjax:c...4; cd to DAVE/DTDs and
create/update symbolic links 'dev' and 'prod' as needed.

Send a note to sim-stds@nasa.gov to announce new file.
