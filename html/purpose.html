      <acronym class="acronym">DAVE-ML</acronym> is intended to encode (for exchange and long-term archive) an
      entire flight vehicle dynamic simulation data package, as is traditionally done in initial
      delivery and updates to engineering development, flight training, and accident investigation
      simulations. It is intended to provide a programming-language-independent representation of
      the aerodynamic, mass/inertia, landing gear, propulsion, and guidance, navigation and control
      laws for a particular vehicle. </p><p> 
      Traditionally, flight simulation data packages are often a combination of paper documents and
      data files on magnetic or optical media. This collection of information is very much
      vendor-specific and is often incomplete or inconsistent. Many times, the preparing facility
      makes incorrect assumptions about how the receiving facility's simulation environment is
      structured. As a result, the re-hosting of the dynamic flight model by the receiving facility
      can take weeks or longer as the receiving facility staff learns the contents and arrangement
      of the data package, the model structure, the various data formats, and variable names/units/sign
      conventions. The staff then spends additional time running check-cases (if any were included
      in the transmittal) and tracking down inevitable differences in results.
    </p><p> 
      There are obvious benefits to automating most of this tedious, manual process.  Often, when a
      pair of facilities has already exchanged one model, the transmission of another model is much
      faster since the receiving facility will probably have devised some scripts and processes to
      convert the data (both model and check-case data). </p><p> The purpose of <acronym class="acronym">DAVE-ML</acronym> is to develop a common exchange format for these
      flight dynamic models. The advantage gained is to enable any simulation facility or laboratory,
      after having written a <acronym class="acronym">DAVE-ML</acronym> import and/or export script, to
      automatically receive and/or transmit such packages (and updates to those packages) rapidly
      with other DAVE-ML-compliant facilities. </p><p>
      To accomplish this goal, the <acronym class="acronym">DAVE-ML</acronym> project is starting with the
      bulkiest part of most aircraft simulation packages: the aerodynamics model. This initial
      version of <acronym class="acronym">DAVE-ML</acronym> can be used to transport a complete aerodynamics model,
      including descriptions of the aerodynamic build-up equations and data tables, and
      include references to the documentation about the aerodynamics model and check-case data. This
      format also lends itself to any static subsystem model (i.e. one that contains no state
      vector) such as the mass and inertia model, or a weapons load-out model, or perhaps a
      navigational database. The only requirement is that model outputs must be unambiguously defined
      in terms of inputs, with no past history (state) information required.
